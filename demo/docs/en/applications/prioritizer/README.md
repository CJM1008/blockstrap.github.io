## Blockstrap Prioritizer

Without building and using our own applications, there would be no real way for us to innovate within the functionality of our own tools. Our journey with Blockstrap started with our desire to build a wallet that did not store any private keys anywhere, could transact with any crypto-currency, and be easily extended via themes and plugins. After building that foundation, we needed to test the fact that [core](../../framework/core/) could handle multiple themes, so we decided to build something simple (over a weekend) in order to ensure wehad a working framework that really was module.

Prioritizer essentially transforms a list of issues into a collection of addresses, which can then be ordered and filtered based upon the number of contributions, amount contributed and (or) formula that is set. It also allowed us to introduce the concept of public and private views as well as basic user roles for administrators.
