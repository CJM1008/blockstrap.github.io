## Blockstrap Wallet

Without building and using our own applications, there would be no real way for us to innovate within the functionality of our own tools. Our journey with Blockstrap started with our desire to build a wallet that did not store any private keys anywhere, could transact with any crypto-currency, and be easily extended via themes and plugins. This is the foundation for that wallet. In the process of building the wallet, we realized that the tools we were building to make it possible were more important than the end result.

The primary features of the wallet include:

* __Entirely HTML5 / Browser Based__
* [Deterministic by Default](../../framework/started/security/#qa_01)
* [Module by Nature](../../framework/modules/)
* [Easily Extended](../../framework/extending/)
* [OpenSource](http://github.com/blockstrap/framework)
* __API Neutral__

Not to mention a one-page 3 minute install as seen below:
