## Extending Blockstrap

Blockstrap can be extended in countless ways, but two preferred patterns include:

* [Themes](themes/)
* [Plugins](../../plugins/)

In addition, modules can be added via [configuration](../core/configuration/) settings.

The following modules have their own APIs too:

* [Buttons](buttons/)
* [Filters](filters/)

Themes and plugins are also able to utilize [hooks](hooks/) for injecting new events into core without having to edit core files.
