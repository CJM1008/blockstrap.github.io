* Support / Access to __localStorage__ - _please note that private browsing prevents access_

#### Tested Support Matrix for Framework

| Browser | Operating System | Version | Support |
|---------|------------------|---------|---------|
|Firefox|MacOSX Mavericks|33.1|Works from Server and Desktop|
|Chrome|MacOSX Mavericks|38.0.2125.122|Only Works from Server|
|Safari|MacOSX Mavericks|7.0.5|Only Works from Server|

If you want to run the framework locally but are having trouble due to not having your own web-server, we would recommend [XAMPP](https://www.apachefriends.org/) or [MAMP](http://www.mamp.info/). These solutions provide a relatively easy way to set-up a server locally on your desktop device, but should not be used for production purposes.
